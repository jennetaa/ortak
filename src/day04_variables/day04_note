Recap
Comments
text directly in the code, it is used to explain the
code, have reminders of what it does
does not get executed
-> When there is an issue in the code, we can comment out
the code as well
types:
// single line comment - comments one lines
/* multi line comment - comments multiple
lines */
/** java docs comment - comments multiple
lines with more functionality */
TODO: allows you to create a reminder, intellij has a
built in feature to show all todo comments
Escape Sequences
allows to use certain characters that are also part of
java syntax
\' '
\" "
\\ \
\n new line
\t tab

Shortcut to comment
command/control + /

Variables
container to hold data/information
allow the values of information to changed, used multiple times
Declare a variable: makes a container/variable ready to be used
dataType variablName;
int age;
Assign a value to a variable: store some value/number into your
container
variableName = value;
age = 10;
Declaring and assigning at the same time
dataType variableName = value;
int age = 10;
DataTypes
In java there is many types.
Primitive datatypes: byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean,
char
Object types: (we will spend more time on this later)
-> String
-> all primitives are lowercase
whole numbers: (ex: 40)
byte
short
int   <- by default
long
floating numbers: (ex: 24.62)
float
double  <- by default
-> compiler uses int and double by default
How to tell the compiler you want long number: use an 'L' at the end
of the number
How to tell the compiler you want float number: use an 'F' at the
end of the number
concatenation
we can use + to add variables to characters, to make a message
reassigning
changing the value something else, old value is lost. Updating the
variable
Q: Can you write numbers starting with 0
no, it becomes a different number
for whole numbers
Hardcoded: directly in the code, so it is difficult to change
shortcut for printing variables: soutv
Need to talk about:
floating numbers
concatenation
reassigning
variable naming rules
class name Olympics
create a variable for the year
print the country and year for next couple events
reassign year value each time. Country name is hard coded
data:
China 2022
France 2024
Italy 2026
Look forward to the year $year for the Olympics to be in $location
Task:
class name: School
declare and assign these variables
number of students in grade 1
number of students in grade 2
number of students in grade 3
number of students in grade 4
number of students in grade 5
total number of students in your school
number of days in a year (have some half day = ~ 100.5)
number of snow days in a year (double)
average gpa in school (3.5) [ranges 1.0 - 4.0]
print all of the variables with unique messages
____________________________________________________________
Variable naming rules
- make the variable names are clear as possible
dont do:
int x;
int a;
- Variables can contains these:
- any letter (A-Z, or a-z)
- any number (0-9)
- only special characters allowed are dollar sign $ and
underscore _
- for multiple words: use camel case.
each new word starts with an uppercase
words: today is saturday
camel case: todayIsSaturday
Pascal case( class names) TodayIsSaturday
- don't use reserved words
- Can't start with a number
int 1age --> invalid
int age1 --> valid
