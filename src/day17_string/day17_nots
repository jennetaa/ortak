-> Scanner class was in java.util
Strings are object types, not primitive data types

Memory
in general:
hard drive storage - where you store data
ram: memory used by the computer
Stack: variable names/reference
Heap: objects are stored
String pool:
located in the heap
it is a special memory location for
String literals
2 ways to create String objects
- String literal
just giving double quotations
- new keyword
using new String("value");
Q: What is the difference between == and .equals()
== compares the objects in the memory
.equals() compares the value, meaning the characters
String methods:
equals(): compares two Strings and give a boolean
it gives true if the String characters are exactly the
same.
equalsIgnoreCase(): compare two Strings and given a boolean
it gives true if the String characters are the same
characters, while ignoring case sensitivity
length(): gives an int of how many characters are in the String
Q: Are spaces characters: yes. Counts as a character for
the length method
