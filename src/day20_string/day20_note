Day 20 String Practice

___________________________________________________________________
Recap
general syntax to use methods: stringObject.method()
Index: a number position. Every character in a String has an index
indexes start from 0
String s = "apple";
01234
charAt(int index): returns the character at the given index
ex: s.charAt(0) --> 'a'
s.charAt(3) --> 'l'
s.charAt(6) -->
StringIndexOutOfBoundsException
-> If you use any index that is not
valid you will get the exception/error
indexOf(): returns the index (int) based on the given argument
(char): return the index where the given char is found in
the String. It returns the first occurrence of that character
ex:
s.indexOf('a') --> 0
s.indexOf('p') --> 1
s.indexOf('z') --> -1
-> When a char is not found
in the String, it returns -1
(String): returns the index of the character sequence in
the String. It returns the index where the sequence starts
ex:
s.indexOf("ppl") --> 1
s.indexOf("le") --> 3
s.indexOf("pear") --> -1
s.indexOf("a") --> 0
(char, int): it returns the index of the given char, but
it starts looking at the given int index number
ex:
String a = "applep"
012345
a.indexOf('p', 2) --> 2
a.indexOf('p', 3) --> 5
(String, int)
lastIndexOf(): returns the index (int) based on the given argument,
but it checks from the end of the String
ex:
s.lastIndexOf('p') --> 2
substring(): returns part of a String based on the arguments
(int): return the String characters starting from the
given index (starting point) until the end of the String. This given index
is included in the resulting String
Ex:
String str = "monday";

012345
str.substring(3) --> day
str.substring(1) --> onday
str.substring(10) -->
StringIndexOutOfBoundsException
(int, int): returns the String characters from the first
argument (index) until the second argument (index). The first index is
included in the resulting String, but the second index is not included
(the stopping point)
String str = "monday";

012345
str.substring(2, 5) --> nda
str.substring(2, 6) --> nday
str.substring(2, 7) -->
StringIndexOutOfBoundsException
these two code do similar thing
s.charAt(0)  -> gives char type
s.substring(0,1) -> gives String type
how to convert any type to String
concatenate a space
usually empty space ""
// ( "" + firstName.charAt(0)).method --> this will also give you
the first character, but as a char type
replace(): allows you to change a certain character/s to another
character/s. Replaces all occurrences of those characters in the String
(char, char): first char is the value you are trying to change
and the second char is the value you are changing it to
Ex:
String a = "apple";
a.replace('p', 'z') --> azzle
(String, String): first String is the value you are trying to
change and the second String is the value you are changing it to
String str = "today is monday";
str.replace(" ", "") --> todayismonday
str.replace("monday", "tuesday") -> today is
tuesday
replaceFirst(): replaces the first occurrence of the characters
