Recap
Scanner
hard code: values directly in the code
ex: int a = 450; // 450 is hard coded
ex: String url = "www.google.com";
dynamic values: value that come from outside of the code
ex: Scanner, website, db, file
ex: int b = SCANNER CODE;
Scanner is a class that allows us to get values from the console.
The Scanner methods allow us to type into the console and depending on the
method, we are able to get different datatypes.
class: java file, has methods and variables. Non primitive datatype
method: group of code, has some functionality
ex: nextInt() method allows us to type a number in the
console and save it to a variable or use it
How do you use the Scanner and its methods
1) import the class
to use a file from a different package we
must import the file we want to use
general syntax:
import package name.class name;
popular names for Scanner: scan, input,
scanner, keyboard
for Scanner:
import java.util.Scanner;
-> imports go between the package and the
class
PIC: order of the java file
content: package, import, class
-> What about String?
String class is in a different package,
how are we using it?
package: java.lang is automatically
imported
2) make a Scanner object (declare a Scanner variable)
syntax:
Scanner name = new
Scanner(System.in);
-> only declared once in each class
3) use the Scanner methods with the name you declared
ex:
name.method()
Scanner methods:
nextByte()
nextShort()
nextInt()
nextLong()
nextFloat()
nextDouble()
nextBoolean()
next(): gives you a String,
but it only accepts one word
nextLine(): gives you a
String, but it allows multiple words. This method also accepts enter
inputs
problem:
whenever we use nextLine()
method after any other Scanner methods the input is consumed by the enter
from the previous input
solution:
add an extra nextLine() just
to handle the enter input, then you can use nextLine() to read a String
value
