Recap
char
a single character in a single quote ' '
every character has a number related to it
boolean
true or false
String
multiple characters in double quotations " "
concatenation: whenever anything/any type is concatenated
with a String, the result becomes a String and the two data are put
together
String is not a primitive datatype. its a class
Type casting
changing the datatype from one to another
order:  [SMALL] byte -> short -> int -> long -> float ->
double [LARGE]
Smaller datatype --> Larger datatype
Widening convention happens automatically
int --> double
Larger datatype --> Smaller
Narrowing convention happens manually
double --> int
Formula to cast:
datatype variable = (datatype you are casting
to) variable/value
Data loss: sometimes when going from a bigger
number to a smaller number or a decimal number to a whole number there can
be data loss, which means the value is changed
char <> int
------------------------------------------------------------
Create a class House
create a main method
- Each the datatype you feel is most appropriate for each variable.
- Create the following variables:
house type, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, number of
kitchens, is there a basement?, is there an attic, is there a pool, is the
house for sale?, cost of the house, address, zipcode, is a park near by,
Rating of surrounding school districts (out of 5),
- Print each variable with a message with the value
Ex: The number of bedrooms is: 4
The number of bathrooms is: 3

Arithmetic Operators
+ addition
- subtraction
* multiplication
/ division
% remainder/modulus
When you use arithmetic operators between two different datatypes
the result will be the bigger type.
- When you use datatypes like short or byte and use some arithmetic
operators the values are changed to int, so the result of the operation is
also int
