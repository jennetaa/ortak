Day 13 If statements
day13_if_statements
____________________________________________________________
multi branch if statements
if without brackets
ternary
__________________________________________________________
Recap
Q: When to use multi branch statements:
when you have multiple conditions that you want to check
and when those statements are related to each other
if (condition) {
// if the condition is true, this code will run
} else if(condition 2){
// if the condition 2 is true, this code will run
} else if(condition 3){
// if the condition 3 is true, this code will run
} else {
// if all the conditions were false, then this code will
run
}
Q: How many else if can you have
as many as you want
Q: How many else can you have
only one at the end
Q: Is else block mandatory
no, it possible to have just single if statement
Multi branch if statements will execute top to bottom like other
code, the condition will be checked and if there is a true condition that
code block will be executed and if statement will be done
Q: What if there is more than 1 true statement
since the code goes from top to bottom, the first true
statement will decide which code block will be run
single if vs multi branch
single if: for each if statement each condition is
checked
if(){
}
if(){
}
multi branch: each if condition will be checked, until
there is a true result
if(){
} else if(){
}
__________________________________________________________
if statements without brackets
you can create if statements without brackets
with brackets:
if(4 > 5){
System.out.println("hello");
}
without brackets:
if(4 > 5)
System.out.println("hello");
when there is an if statement without brackets, only the line after
it is the if block
without brackets, you cannot have more than one line of code in that
if block
suggestion: don't be lazy, always use brackets
__________________________________________________________
Ternary
a way to write an if statement quickly
syntax:
resultVariable = boolean_expression ? trueValue :
falseValue;
? -> if, but it comes after boolean
: -> else
ex:
int score = 90;
if(score > 75){
System.out.println("pass");
} else {
System.out.println("fail");
}
-------
int score = 90;
String result;
if(score > 75){
result = "pass";
} else {
result = "fail";
}
System.out.println(result);
-------
int score = 90;
String result;
result = score > 75 ? "pass" : "fail";
