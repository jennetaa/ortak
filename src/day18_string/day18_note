Recap
String class
__________________________________________________________
String
String is a class, so we make objects to use it
-> holds multiple characters
the class is found in the java.lang package
-> is imported automatically
2 ways to create String objects
1) String literal: using double quotations with nothing else
Ex: String s = "Saturday";
-> made in the String pool
2) new keyword: new String("");
Ex: String s = new String("Saturday");
Memory
Stack: references (variable name)
Heap: objects (variables), String pool
String pool: a special memory location for String literals. It saves
memory by not having to make Strings over and over again
String is immutable: String objects cannot be changed after being created
--> to compare Strings we should never use ==
== with Strings compare the objects to each other
String methods:
general syntax: stringObject.method()
equals(): checks if the Strings value/objects have the same
characters
-> cares about case sensitivity
returns boolean
equalsIgnoreCase(): checks if the String value/object have the same
characters, but it ignores case sensitivity
returns boolean
length(): checks and returns the number of characters
-> spaces are characters
returns int
toUpperCase(): converts all the characters in the String to
uppercase letters
returns String
toLowerCase(): converts all characters in the String to lowercase
letters
returns String
startsWith(""): checks if the String starts with the characters
given in the parenthesis
returns boolean
endsWith(""):  checks if the String ends with the characters given
in the parenthesis
return boolean
contains(""): checks if the String has the given character sequence
in it
returns boolean
isEmpty(): checks if your String has characters or not. If there is
no characters, it is empty
return boolean
isBlank(): checks if your String has non white space characters or
not. If there is only white spaces it is blank
return boolean
trim(): removes spaces in the beginning and end
-> spaces anywhere between other characters are not
removed
return String
