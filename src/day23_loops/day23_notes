for loop
____________________________________________________________
Recap
Loops
repeating statements. Code that will be run multiple times.
iteration: every repetition/cycle/execution of the statements in the
loop
infinite loop: loop that does not stop
loop types:
while: continues to iterate as long as the given boolean
value is true. Checks the boolean first, then runs the code statements,
then checks the boolean from the start again. That cycle repeats
- syntax:
while(boolean){
// statements
}
do while: similar to while loop, but the first
iteration/execution is always run at least one time and then the boolean
value is checked. If the boolean is true the loop will iterate again and
then boolean is checked again. That cycle repeats
- syntax:
do {
// statements that will
repeat
} while(boolean);
-> while and do while: used when the number of iterations is not
known
for loop: used when the number of iterations is known
____________________________________________________________
For loop: when there is a fixed number of iterations
for(initialization; boolean condition; update){
// statements
}
for(int i = 1; i <= 10; i++ ){
System.out.println(i);
}
/*
flow of for loop
1) the loop executes the initialization part to declare and
assign a variable
in our ex: int i = 1;
initialization part runs once in the beginning
2) boolean condition/ termination condition
-> if the boolean is true: the loop will execute the
statements
-> if the boolean is false: the loop will stop
in our ex: i <= 10
3) the statements in the code body are executed top to bottom
in our ex: System.out.println(i);
4) update happens -- this is the end of an iteration
in our ex: i++
5) goes back to step 2 and repeats

For loop with String
to read/use every character in a String:
s.charAt(i)
where s is a String
and
where i is an int number
what is the termination condition with String in loops
i starts at 0, usually
i < s.length() or i <= s.length() - 1
if you check for characters next to the current index
using: i + 1
then you should stop the loop earlier
using i < length - 1
