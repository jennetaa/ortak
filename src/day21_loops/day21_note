[Middle char]
Given a String, write a program to display the middle character of a
string
a) If the length of the string is even there will be two middle
characters. b) If the length of the string is odd there will be one middle

Loops
Loops in programming are used to repeat statements multiple times
Loop types:
while loop, do while loop, for loop, for each loop
while loop: loop that continues to run as long as the boolean value
is true
syntax:
while(boolean_expression){
// statements that are repeated
} // while loop ending point
while loop execution flow:
boolean expression is checked
-> if the boolean is true
the loop will run, which means the code
inside of the while loop are executed top to bottom
then it goes back up to check the
boolean expression again
-> if the boolean is false: the loop will
stop
infinite loop: a loop that will continue to run, over and over again
without stopping. The boolean will never be false
iteration: each cycle of the loop. The statements are run each time
you iterate
