switch statements
____________________________________________________________
Switch
conditional statement: controlling the program
switch statements only compare exact values ==
-> relational operators ( > < >= <= !=) are not allow in
switch
switch(variable) {
case x:
// statements
break;
default:
}
switch: keyword to make a switch statement
variable: value being checked/compared in the switch
on these types are allowed as the input variable: byte,
short, int, char, String
which means these types are not allowed as the input
variable: float, double, long, boolean
case: value that you are checking for. The datatype of the case
should match the datatype of the variable being checked
statements: any code you want to run when the case matches
break: stops and exits the switch statement
default: case when no other cases match
example:
int a = 3;
switch(a) {
case 1:
// statements
break;
case 2:
// statements
break;
case 3:
System.out.println("Three");
break;
}
Execution Flow
if statements: go top to bottom. Checks each condition
one at a time until a condition is true or there is no more conditions
switch statement: the case matches first, then the
statements are executed, top to bottom, from that case until the end of
the switch or break keyword
