____________________________________________________________
Recap
String methods:
general syntax: stringObject.method()
equals(): checks if the Strings value/objects have the same characters
-> cares about case sensitivity
returns boolean
equalsIgnoreCase(): checks if the String value/object have the same
characters, but it ignores case sensitivity
returns boolean
length(): checks and returns the number of characters
-> spaces are characters
returns int
toUpperCase(): converts all the characters in the String to uppercase
letters
returns String
toLowerCase(): converts all characters in the String to lowercase
letters
returns String
startsWith(""): checks if the String starts with the characters given
in the parenthesis
returns boolean
endsWith(""):  checks if the String ends with the characters given in
the parenthesis
return boolean
contains(""): checks if the String has the given character sequence in
it
returns boolean
isEmpty(): checks if your String has characters or not. If there is no
characters, it is empty
return boolean
isBlank(): checks if your String has non white space characters or
not. If there is only white spaces it is blank
return boolean
trim(): removes spaces in the beginning and end
-> spaces anywhere between other characters are not removed
return String

Indexes
every character in a String has a position where it is located called
an index
index numbers start from 0
Q: How can I find the last index of a String
length - 1
Why does that work? Because index starts from 0
method(_______)  <-- when you give some information in the parenthesis
of a method it is called an argument
charAt(index): returns the character at the given index number
returns char
substring(): returns part of a String
(int): the returned String starts from the given index number
until the end of the String.
(int, int): the returned String starts from the first given index
number until the second given index number. The first index is included,
but the last index is not included in the characters
Ex:
String s = "abc";
s.substring(1) --> bc
indexOf(): returns the index number of the given char/String argument
returns int
-> if you try to find a character that does not exist in the
String, the method will return -1
(char): it will find the first occurrence of the given character
in the String and returns the index of that character
(String): it will find the first occurrence of the given character
sequence (String) and it returns the index of the first character of that
sequence
(char/String, int): it will find the char/String (first argument)
in the String starting from the index of the second argument
Later:
lastIndexOf()
replace()
replaceFirst()
