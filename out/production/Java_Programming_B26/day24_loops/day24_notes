Day 24 Loops

____________________________________________________________
for loop
break and continue statements
__________________________________________________________
Recap
while/do while: when the number of iterations is not known, it is
based on other factors
for loop: used when the number of iterations is fixed/known
for(initialization; termination condition; update){
statements
}
--> for syntax each section is optional. You must have the semi
colon
for( ; ; ) --> infinite loop
for(int i = 0 ; i < 5 ; ) --> infinite loop
for(int i = 0 ; ; i++ ) --> infinite loop
flow of the for loop:
1) initialization: declare and assign a variable that is
used in the loop. Usually used to keep track of the number of iterations.
Other use of the variable can be done, for example using the number as an
index of a String
--> this runs once, in the beginning
2) termination condition: the boolean that determines if
you should run/continue the loop
if the boolean is true: the statements in the
loop will execute
if the boolean is false: the loop stop
3) the code in the loop body is executed - this is one
iteration of the statements
4) update: changes the variable to avoid infinite loop
5) going back up to step 2 - iteration is complete, next
cycle will start
Strings with loops
Q: What does a loop iterating through a String loop like
for(int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++){
}
These are possible ways to write the termination
condition:
i < s.length();
i <= s.length() - 1;
ex: String s = "java"
i < s.length();  i < 4   -->
stop before 4 because it is not a valid index
i <= s.length() - 1; i <= 3
--> stops at the last index of 3
--> indexes start from 0, so our loop value i is set to
start at 0, then it updates by 1 each iteration. The loop will continue as
long as the number i is less than the length, which means the loop will
only used valid index numbers
Q: What does a loop look like if you go backward in the String
for(int i = s.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--){
}
--> we start our loop from the last index of the String.
To get the last index of a String we can use the length - 1. Then the loop
will update by subtracting 1 each iteration as long as the number is more
than or equal to 0, because those are the valid index numbers
Q: How to dynamically read each character
s.charAt(i)
where i is the variable name declare in the
loop
intellij shortcut: fori
break statement in loop:
stops and exits the loop
continue statement in loop:
it will skip the rest of the iteration and goes to the
update part.
any code after a continue will not run for that iteration
ex:
for(int i = 1; i <= 100; i++){
if(i % 2 == 1){
continue;
}
System.out.print(i + " ");
}
