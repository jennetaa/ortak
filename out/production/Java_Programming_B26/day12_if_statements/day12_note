What is debugging:
to find the reason of your issue/error in the code, you are able to
check line by line
Debug:
1) create a breakpoint by clicking on the gray bar next to the code
lines
2) click the on the green run button, but select the debug option
3) then to progress from line to line you can click the step over
button (execute 1 line at a time)
4) Debugger window/ Console: you can swap between the windows to see
the console and the debugger information
