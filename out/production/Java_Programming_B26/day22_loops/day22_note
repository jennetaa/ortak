while loop

Recap
Ternary
types need to match
type s = boolean (type) ? (type)
Loops
repeating some code statements multiple times
while loop: repeat some code statements using a boolean value.
usually used when the number of iterations are not
defined.
flow/execution order of while loop:
1) checks the boolean expression
-> when the boolean is true:
execute the statements
inside of the while block (inside of the curly brackets), top to bottom
the loop goes back to step
1)
-> when the boolean is false:
the loop stops. the code
resume execution from after the loop
iteration: one cycle/execution of the code
infinite loop: the loop continues to run, with no stop
-> in while loop it means the boolean will never be
false, it stays always true
avoid infinite loops
do while
similar to the while loop but the first iteration/execution always
happens no matter the boolean expressions
do{
// statements
} while(boolean_expression);
