Right click -> refactor -> rename
Logical Operators
I want to do this:
5 < num < 10 --> cannot do this in java
Evaluate/compare two boolean expressions and result in a boolean
value
one comparison and one comparison -> result
num > 5 AND num < 10
AND Logic
&&
both expressions need to be true for the result to be
true
OR logic
||
at least one expressions to be true for the result to be
true
NOT logic
!
opposite boolean value
short circuit: more efficient. if the output of the expression is
known the other condition is not executed
&& AND checks if both boolean expressions are true.
If the first expressions is true it checks
the second one for true to get a result of true
If the first expression is false then the
second expression is not executed at all
|| OR checks if both boolean expressions are true.
If the first expressions is true it doesn't
execute the second expressions
If the first expression is false then the
second expressions is executed
& execute both expressions not matter what
| execute both expressions not matter what

Scanner
Scanner is a CLASS that has METHODS that allow us to get input
values from the console
classes are java files
methods are a block of code that is ready to use. do/have actions
Why do we use Scanner?
To avoid hard coded information, we want to use/get
information from outside of the code
How can you use Scanner
1) import the class
allow us to use a different class/file
that are in different packages
for Scanner: import java.util.Scanner;
-> imports go between the package and class
PIC: package, import, class
-> you must import to use Scanner
2) creating the Scanner object(variable)
object allows us to use the methods
syntax:
Scanner nameOfScanner = new
Scanner(System.in);
3) use the methods
to use the actions that are defined we can
use Scanner method with the object we made (step 2)
general syntax:
nameOfScanner.method()
methods:
nextByte()
nextShort()
nextInt()
nextLong()
nextFloat()
nextDouble()
nextBoolean()
String types:
next() : one word
nextLine(): multiple words
