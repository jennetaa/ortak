Switch
control flow statement that allows us match values via cases. Checks
if the given value is equal to any defined case
switch(value){
case possible_value:
// statements
break;
default:
// statements
}
case possible_value: expected value that you are checking equality
with. Datatype matches the value datatype
valid datatypes: byte, short, int, String, char
invalid datatypes: float, double, boolean, long
cannot have duplicates cases. cases must be unique
break: stops the switch statement
default: case that is executed if no other case matches
it be anywhere in the switch
Execution flow:
takes the value and tries to match it with a case. If the
case is there, the statements are executed from that point, top to bottom,
until the end of the switch or a break statement
What is the difference between if, switch, and ternary
if statements:
in most cases if statements are used for
controlling the flow of a program
work with boolean logic
able to use all datatypes
multiple types that handle multiple different
scenarios
switch statements:
can only compare values, check if the values
are equal
when the cases are known, when there is a
fixed number of exact possible values
ternary:
used sometimes when there is simple boolean
logic and a value must be given back
the value is usually assigned to a
variable or used right away
- cannot be used when there is only one
possible outcome
any switch or ternary can be converted to an if statement
